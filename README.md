# 📖 The "Why" Behind This Project
As CSE students, we realized that while we are great at managing complex code, we often struggle to manage our own monthly pocket money and expenses. Most finance apps were either too cluttered with ads or too complex for a student's simple needs. 

We decided to build **Smart Finance Tracker** to bridge this gap—a sleek, logic-driven solution that turns boring numbers into meaningful visual insights.

# 🌟 The Vision
Our goal is to move beyond simple data entry. We are building a tool that:
1. **Identifies Patterns:** Are you spending too much on weekends? 
2. **Visualizes Growth:** Turning abstract numbers into interactive Pie Charts and Bar Graphs.
3. **Encourages Discipline:** Automated alerts when you are about to cross your self-imposed limits.

## 🚀 Technical Architecture (The Logic)
We chose the **MERN Stack** for its scalability and performance:
- **Frontend (React.js):** For a smooth, single-page application experience.
- **Data Viz (Chart.js):** To provide real-time visual feedback on spending habits.
- **Backend (Node/Express):** To handle secure transaction logic.
- **Database (MongoDB):** Flexible schema to handle various expense categories.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Smart Dashboard:** A bird's eye view of your financial health.
- **Category-Wise Analysis:** Know exactly where your money goes (Food, Subscriptions, Travel).
- **Interactive Visuals:** Dynamic charts that update as you add transactions.
- **Secure Auth:** Ensuring your financial data stays private and yours.

## 👥 The Team
- **Pragya soni (@Pragya1613):** Leading Frontend Architecture & UI Logic.
- **Jyoti bagdi (jyotibagdi-07)** Driving Backend APIs & Database Schema.
